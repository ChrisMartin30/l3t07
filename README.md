# README file for task

This file was lacking a README file, so one has been created.

The Task from an earlier stage was to create a list of jokes in a python file, then use the random.choice function to select a item from the list to be printed on each running of the code.

## Further improvements that could be made
- [ ] Add more jokes to the list
- [ ] Rather than having to run the program each time to get a random joke, create a "press X to see another, press Y to quit"
